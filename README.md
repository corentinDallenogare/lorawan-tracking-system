> Wild animals tracking - AN IoT solution

# About the project

This project is a solution to help the [*Faune & Biotopes Association*](http://www.faune-biotopes.be/ "Faune & Biotopes Association homepage") to manage their tracking of wild animals using IoT devices.

This project is proposed by Faune & Biotopes Association in partnership with [EPHEC Louvain-la-Neuve](https://www.ephec.be/) and [Proximus Enco](https://enco.io/).

## Material

- LoRaWAN Rapid Development Kit
  - Sodaq Mbili card Rev6 (based on Arduino)
  - LoRa network connection chip developed by Microchip
  - Antenna
  - Battery
  - Sensors: Grove - GPS, Grove - 3-Axis Digital Accelerometer (+/- 1.5g), Grove - Light Sensor v1.2.
- Proximus EnCo account

We basically won't use other stuff included in the LoRaWAN RDK even though some of them (TPH v2, Grove - Button (P)) could be useful for a first temporary sketch in order to familiarize with LoRaWAN.

## Faune & Biotopes Association

Faune & Biotopes is engaged in activities related to the study and the management of wildlife and habitats in a multifunctional and integrated perspective.

Faune & Biotopes considers that a good knowledge and good management of the faune and its habitats is one of the most effective approach for the conservation of the nature.
